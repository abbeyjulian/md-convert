# md-convert
Convert documents to markdown (WIP)

Instructions (Mac):
1. The first time you set up this program, run ```initial_setup.sh```
2. To run the program, run ```run.sh```

On Mac, to run a shell script use ```.\name_of_script.sh```

Note: you may need to edit the shell scripts to change the filepath of bash. To find where bash is installed on your machine, run ```which bash```.

Note: you may need to make the shell script executable. To do so, run
```chmod +x name_of_script.sh```

Note: all commands need to be run from the same directory where these files are saved. Use ```cd``` to change directories within terminal.

Alternatively, run the executable found at ```dist/pdf_to_markdown.exe```
